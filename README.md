# .Net C# Developer Test (Internship)

## Project Description
This is a simple C# console application created as part of a developer test for a .NET C# Internship. The application consists of several tasks demonstrating basic programming concepts, including variable declarations, conditionals, loops, arrays, and methods.

---

## Tasks
### **Task 1: Variable Declaration and Initialization**
- Declares and initializes the following variables:
  - `name`: String with value "John Doe"
  - `age`: Integer with value `25`
  - `isAdmin`: Boolean with value `true`
- Prints the values to the console.

### **Task 2: Check Even or Odd**
- Accepts an integer input from the user.
- Checks whether the input number is even or odd.
- Prints "Even" or "Odd" accordingly.

### **Task 3: Print Numbers 1 to 10**
- Uses a `for` loop to print numbers from `1` to `10` to the console.

### **Task 4: Array Operations**
- Declares an integer array with values `{2, 4, 6, 8, 10}`.
- Calculates and prints the sum of all elements in the array.
- Prints each element using a `foreach` loop.

### **Task 5: Greeting Method**
- Defines a method named `Greet` that takes a string parameter and prints a personalized greeting in the format:  
  `"Hello, <name>!"`
- Calls the `Greet` method with the name "Alice" from the `Main` method.

## How to Run the Application
1. Open the project in **Visual Studio**.
2. Ensure the `Program.cs` file contains the code for the tasks.
3. Run the application (`Ctrl + F5` or `F5`).
4. Follow the prompts in the console.
